# learning-along-the-way
a small preview about my academic life

## the journey 
thats all i did since the first year of collage

### front-end and back-end 
I started in the very beginning with front-end (HTML and CSS) started javascript but i stopped before even starting with back-end when i noticed its not gonna work for me because of multiple reasons 
    1- the competition was very strong and u had to be the one in a thousand to find a good job
    2- salaries were not that high for the amount of effort and time u put into a single project as fullstack project
    3- i got bored ToT

### game dev
i started with unreal  and unity engines yet I stopped after couple of days for the same reasons 

### 3d design 
that was the most interesting among all those as i still enjoy 3d modeling yet i cant take it as a full carrier but only as a hobby for the same reasons and more that every course and extension to help u make ur dream project and progress faster was all paid. u will rarely find anything for free so u have to do it all on ur own. of course that turned me off for the most part yet i still enjoy it and will find a way to free some time to learn it and make my dream 3d world come to reality. 

### AI/ML 
barely started it couple of days ago yet i find it more promising than all the others 
will notify u later of any updates
